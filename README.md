Having A Bit of FUN with Intrinio 

Welcome to the Intrinio API. Through our Intrinio Data Marketplace, we offer a wide selection of financial data feeds sourced by our own proprietary processes as well as from many data vendors. The primary application of the Intrinio API is for use in third-party applications and integrations or for end-users utilizing the Excel add-in.

The Intrinio API uses HTTPS verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure, which makes it easy to request data from Intrinio.

Authentication is administered over URL Parameter Authentication. Responses are delivered in JSON format.
